Docusaurus is a website generator that runs on the React ecosystem that is great for building static content such as project documentation, your personal home page, a portfolio. However, if you're not using advanced features, you don't have to know much React at all as you can use the default templates and write your content in Markdown.

## Something Missing?

If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus) for us, or send a tweet mentioning the [@docusaurus](https://twitter.com/docusaurus) Twitter account.

For new feature requests, you can create a post on our [Canny board](/feedback), which is a handy tool for roadmapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!
