A large part of site configuration is done by editing the `siteConfig.js` file.

## User Showcase

The `users` array is used to store objects for each project/user that you want to show on your site. Currently this field is used by example the `pages/en/index.js` and `pages/en/users.js` files provided. Each user object should have `caption`, `image`, `infoLink`, and `pinned` fields. The `caption` is the text showed when someone hovers over the `image` of that user, and the `infoLink` is where clicking the image will bring someon. The `pinned` field determines whether or not it shows up on the `index` page.

Currently this `users` array is used only by the `index.js` and `users.js` example files. If you do not wish to have a users page or show users on the `index` page, you may remove this section.

## siteConfig Fields

The `siteConfig` object contains the bulk of the configuration settings for your website.

### Mandatory Fields

`title` - Title for your website.

`tagline` - Tagline for your website.  

`url` - url for your site.

`baseUrl` - baseUrl for your site.

`projectName` - Project name.

`headerLinksInternal` - Header links for targets on this site. `'LANGUAGE'` will be replaced by whatever language the page is for, for example, `'en'`.

`headerLinksExternal` - Header links for targets outside this site.

`headerIcon` - url for icon used in header navigation bar.

`favicon` - url for site favicon.

`colors` - Simple color configurations for the site. `primaryColor` is the color used the header navigation bar and sidebars. `secondaryColor` is the color seen in the second row of the header navigation bar when the site window is narrow (including on mobile). `prismColor` is the color used in the background of syntax highlighting for code in documentation. It is recommended to be the same color as `primaryColor` in `rgba` form with an alpha value of `0.03`.

### Optional Fields

`editUrl` - url for editing docs, usage example: `editUrl + 'en/doc1.md'`. If this field is omitted, there will be no "Edit this Doc" button for each document.

`externalLinkTarget` - Target attribute for header external links. If this field is omitted, the default target of `"_self"` will be used.

`users` - The `users` array mentioned earlier.

`disableHeaderTitle` - An option to disable showing the title in the header next to the header icon. Exclude this field to keep the header as normal, otherwise set to `true`.

`disableTitleTagline` - An option to disable showing the tagline in the title of main pages. Exclude this field to keep page titles as `Title â€¢ Tagline`. Set to `true` to make page titles just `Title`.

`separateCss` - Folders inside which any `css` files will not be processed and concatenated to Docusaurus's styles. This is to support static `html` pages that may be separate from Docusaurus with completely separate styles.

`footerIcon` - url for a footer icon. Currently used in the `core/Footer.js` file provided as an example, but it can be removed from that file.

`recruitingLink` - url for the `Help Translate` tab of language selection when languages besides English are enabled. This can be included you are using translations but does not have to be.

`algolia` - Information for Algolia search integration. If this field is excluded, the search bar will not appear in the header.

`gaTrackingId` - Google Analytics tracking ID to track page views.
